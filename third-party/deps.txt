Lua
Has it's own special build needs since we recommend luajit
http://luajit.org/install.html

Once built, the third-party property sheet may need to be configured for its folders. We currently have luaJIT-2.0.3\src added to the c++ include dir and lib dir. And lua51.lib added to input libraries.

The dll, eg lua51.dll will need to be placed next to any and all exes. Currently this is handled by a build post step that copies this file to bin for you

SFML
http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.3.1/
Currently using sfml 2.3.1 and configured in gec property sheet. In order to link to correct debug and release libs, will require addition gec-debug and gec-release property sheets.
