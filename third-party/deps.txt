Lua
Has it's own special build needs since we recommend luajit
http://luajit.org/install.html

Once built, the third-party property sheet may need to be configured for its folders. We currently have luaJIT-2.0.3\src added to the c++ include dir and lib dir. And lua51.lib added to input libraries.

The dll, eg lua51.dll will need to be placed next to any and all exes. We are working on a post build step to copy the file for you.
